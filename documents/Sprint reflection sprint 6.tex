\section{Sprint reflection sprint 6}

\subsection{Main Problems Encountered}

\emph{Problem 1}. We found out that some issues were not closed, nor answered shortly. We think that having many idle issues is not that good.\\
\emph{Reaction}. We will make sure to look at issues more frequently and discuss whether to close them, or applying a fix to them.\\ 
\\
\emph{Problem 2}. We also found out that some pull request were idle too. This is not good either since the longer we wait (if we even want them to be merged) the more rebases we will need to apply. \\
\emph{Reaction.} We will discuss on them more frequently and decide to close them if we won't merge them.
\\

\subsection{Adjustments for next sprint plan}
We will look more into issues and pull request that are not of high priority so that we will not forget them.
