\section{Sprint reflection sprint 7}

\subsection{Main Problems Encountered}

\emph{Problem 1}. We encounter some integration bugs while setting up the demo for Monday.\\
\emph{Reaction}. We tried out all our functionality that will be present in the demo and fixed the bugs that were still in the code.\\
\\
\emph{Problem 2}. We found out that the Emotion base is working. this means that the emotion are in the base, but somehow we cannot find out why we cannot query the emotions from the base.\\
\emph{Reaction}. We will all look into this problem and contact GOAL programmers if we can't find out how it works.\\


\subsection{Adjustments for next sprint plan}
For the next sprint, we will look into more integration test. Although in GOAL and Gamygdala it is not that easy to make integration test (since the outcome can be different each time you run) we will try to test as many things as possible. For the Emotion base, we will try to get this working as soon as possible. If we do not make any progress on this part, we will discuss this with the GOAL programmers.
