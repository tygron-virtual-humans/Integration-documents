\section{Introduction}
For our context project we work in a large group that is subdivided into different smaller group. In total we have 4 groups of 5 students that work together. Together the whole group will make a proof of concept by creating a game in the Tygron engine,creating an interface between the Tygron engine and \gls{GOAL} and creating both a plug-in and an integration of the \gls{Gamygdala} emotional engine in GOAL.The specific task of our subgroup is to provide the group that will create an agent with an integration of Gamygdala in GOAL. It is not our task to implement the engine itself, since it is already present, but it is our job to integrate it in GOAL in a way that programmers, like the other groups, can make use of this when creating virtual humans.
\\
First of all this document will describe the product's requirements based on the MoSCoW method. More information on this method is found in the glossary. Secondly, a road map is specified where you have an overview of the sprint weeks and the tasks that will be worked on each week. Furthermore a list of user stories is given. These are numbered so that in the road map and in the release plan it is very clear which tasks and user stories are linked together. Finally there is a section on the Definition of Done. This involves all the specific agreements on when a certain task is completed. 
\section{Product}
In this section you can find the specific tasks our product should fulfill.
\subsection{High-level product backlog}
By using the \gls{MoSCoW} method we can subdivide the high level specifications into the following. The subsections decrease in importance or priority. This means that for example the MUST-haves are way more important to implement than the COULD-haves. This method is very handy and more information can be found in the glossary or references.
\subsubsection*{Must haves}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An \gls{agent} in GOAL must have an equivalent in Gamygdala.
	\item The agent's goals in GOAL should also be present in Gamygdala for that agent. This means that if you define a goal for an agent in GOAL that the Gamygdala engine must also know of this. New goals must be communicated to Gamygdala.
	\item It must be possible to define how good or bad a belief is for certain goals.
	\item It must be possible to define relations between agents in GOAL.
	\item It must be possible to have these relations also present in Gamygdala. Again, it must be the case that when a relation is created in GOAL, the Gamygdala engine knows about this relation. Otherwise no emotions between two agents can be calculated.
	\item It must be possible to retrieve the emotional state of an agent in the same way as his beliefs.
	\item it must be able to setup an initial emotion of an agent.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection*{Should haves}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It should be possible to set the gain to a specific value.
	\item It should be possible to set the decay to a specific function.
	\item The  Gamygdala goals and its properties should be possible to change. This also includes the relations regarding beliefs and goals.
	\item It should be possible to display the emotional states in the simple IDE for debugging.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Could haves}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It could be possible to set a custom decay function.
	\item It could be possible to change relations during runtime.
	
	\item It could be possible for an agent to reason about other agents emotional bases.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Won't haves}
\begin{itemize}
	\item eclipse plug-in
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Road map}
\begin{itemize}
	\item week 1: seminars
	\item week 2: understanding Gamygdala by testgame
	\item week 3: setting up goal and research on both goal and Gamygdala.
	\item week 4: agents in goal should get in Gamygdala their equivalent + goals. relations between agent/goals definition/
	\item week 5:  Extra mental database for emotions of an agent. Retrieve emotions.
	\item week 6: debug tool + updating relations (between believes/goals agents/agents) + setting gain/decay function
	\item week 7: implementing ability to set custom decay function
	\item week 8: used for tasks that are not finished
	\item week 9: used for tasks that are not finished
	\item week 10: presentations + finishing
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Product backlog}
In this section you can find an overview of the backlog and release plan.
\subsection{User}
We define a user as a programmer that wants to use GOAL to develop an AI identity. While doing this, he wants to involve emotions and develop his identity in such a way that he can use emotions to trigger actions, but also actions in the environment (via percepts) that change his emotions would be very handy for the user. The user has a good understanding of the programming language GOAL. He has a very small understanding of Gamygdala.
\subsection{User stories of features}
\begin{itemize}
\item As a programmer I want to be able to define a relationship between beliefs and goals so that these effect the emotional state of the agent. It must be similar to define goals in GOAL.

\item As a programmer I want to be able to define relations between different agents.

\item As a programmer I want to be able to run my GOAL-agent and see the emotional state he is in.

\item As a programmer I want to be able to query the emotional base in the same way as the believe base. This so that the agent can reason about it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User stories of know-how acquisition}
\begin{itemize}
\item I want to be able to get a better understanding of Gamygdala by reading through the documentation so that more complex things could be implemented.

\item As a programmer I want to be able to get a better understanding of the integration of Gamygdala in GOAL by reading documentations or papers. This so that I can reason about it and create more complex solutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Release plan}
\subsubsection{Milestone 1 - week 6}
For week six we need to have a working version of basic integration so that the other group creating the virtual human is able to use this and experiment. If we don't give them any version to work with, it will be too late for them to use the integration of the Gamygdala engine in GOAL. Minimal features are the features we planned until week 6.
\subsubsection{MileStone2 - end}
At the end we need to finish our product. The real minimal features are the must haves we have defined earlier. The bare minimum is thus that the features of milestone 1 work perfectly and are tested thoroughly.
\pagebreak
\section{Definition of Done}
We consider something as done if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item test coverage of at least 75\%
	\item documentation of new implemented things must be present
	\item at least two other colleagues agreed on the implementation ans also consider it as done.
\end{itemize}
